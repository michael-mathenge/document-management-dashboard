###### <ins>Installation Instructions</ins>
1. Create a [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/what-is-maven.html) spring boot application via this link [spring initializr](https://start.spring.io/)
        Add these dependencies:
        - spring-boot-starter-parent
        - spring-boot-starter-data-jpa
        - spring-boot-starter-thymeleaf
        - spring-boot-starter-web
        - ojdbc8 (or relevant database drivers)
        - spring-boot-configuration-processor
        - lombok
        - spring-boot-starter-tomcat
        - spring-boot-starter-test
      
2. Unzip and open the directory in IDE. (If you did not generate the application from your IDE)
        File -> New Project from existing sources -> navigate to unzipped folder until you get to POM.xml then open that.

3. Navigate to your group package location (src/main/java/com/mike/<project_name>), e.g. com.mike - right-click - new - package - add the package name;
        now it will appear like e.g. com.mike.controllers. Open the following packages using the above method.
        -models
        -controllers
        -repositories
        -services
        
4. Understanding Java Spring logic
        #### @Controller classes serve as C from MVC. Note that the real controller in Spring MVC is DispatcherServlet that will use the specific @Controller class to handle the URL request.

        #### @Controller classes should only have access to @Service classes through interfaces. Similar, @Service classes should only have access to other @Service classes and for a specific set of @Repository classes through interfaces.

        #### @Service classes should serve for your service layer. Here you should put your business logic. The service layer is there to provide logic to operate on the data sent to and from the DAO and the client.

        #### @Repository classes should serve for your data access layer. Here you should put CRUD logic: insert, update, delete, select.

        #### @Service, @Repository and your @entity classes will be M from MVC. JSP and other view technologies(e.g. JSP, Thymeleaf etc.) will conform V from MVC.

        #### The @Id annotation is inherited from javax.persistence.Idï¼Œ indicating the member field below is the primary key of current entity. Hence your Hibernate                and spring framework as well as you can do some reflect works based on this annotation.
        #### The @GeneratedValue annotation is to configure the way of increment of the specified column(field). For example when using Mysql, you may specify                      auto_increment in the definition of table to make it self-incremental, and then use @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
